The film begins with Yuvraj Vijay Singh (Salman Khan), the crown prince of Pritampur, who is engaged to Princess Maithili (Sonam Kapoor), a humanitarian from a neighboring kingdom. However, Vijay is unhappy with his life and feels suffocated by his strict father, King Dashrath Singh (Anupam Kher), and his scheming half-brother, Yuvraj Ajay Singh (Neil Nitin Mukesh), who wants to kill him and take over the throne.
 
On the other hand, Prem Dilwale (Salman Khan) is a cheerful and carefree stage actor who performs Ram Leela shows in Ayodhya. He is smitten by Maithili after seeing her photo and decides to meet her in person. He gets a chance to do so when he is hired by Vijay's loyal manager, Deewan Sahab (Anupam Kher), to impersonate Vijay after the latter is attacked by Ajay's henchmen.
