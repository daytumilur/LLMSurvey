Autocom Delphi 2013.3 Keygen Activator RX is a software tool that allows users to activate the Autocom or Delphi software for car and truck diagnostics. Autocom and Delphi are brands of vehicle communication interfaces (VCI) that enable communication between a computer and a vehicle's electronic control units (ECU). The software provides various functions such as reading and clearing fault codes, displaying live data, performing actuator tests, coding and programming, etc.
 
The keygen activator is a program that generates a valid activation file (xml) based on the user's serial number and hardware key. The activation file is needed to unlock the full features of the software and remove any limitations or blacklists. The keygen activator also includes a patch that disables the automatic update by internet, prevents virus warnings, and works on all serials.
