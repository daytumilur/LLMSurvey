## Why Use Geo 5 Software?
 
Geo 5 software offers many advantages for geotechnical engineers and geologists, such as:

- User-friendly graphical interface: Geo 5 software has a unified environment and intuitive top-down workflow that makes it easy to use and does not require any special training. You can input data, perform calculations, view results and generate reports in a few clicks.
- BIM support: Geo 5 software allows you to export data to common BIM formats (IFC, LandXML) and share them with third-party programs. This facilitates collaboration and coordination among different disciplines and stakeholders.
- Comprehensive text and graphical output: Geo 5 software produces detailed output reports that can be easily edited or exported to PDF or MS Word formats. You can also view graphical results such as diagrams, charts, contours, cross-sections and animations.
- Programs linked together: Geo 5 software enables you to transfer data between individual programs using Geoclipboardâ¢, and several programs enable transfer of the whole structure for further analysis. This saves you time and ensures consistency.
- Combination of analytical methods and FEM: Geo 5 software enables you to compare two independent solutions for the same problem. You can use analytical methods for quick and effective design and verification, or use FEM for more complex and realistic analysis. This increases the safety and objectivity of your results.
- From the geological survey to the advanced design: Geo 5 software integrates geological data modeling with advanced geotechnical tasks. You can collect geological data in the field using the mobile app for borehole logging, import them into the Stratigraphy program, create a subbase model, and then perform various analyses using other programs.
