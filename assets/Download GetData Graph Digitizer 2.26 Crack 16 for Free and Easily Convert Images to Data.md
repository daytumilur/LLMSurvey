First, you need to open the image file that contains the graph you want to digitize. You can do this by clicking on the "Open" button on the toolbar or by selecting "File" > "Open" from the menu. You can also drag and drop the file into the program window. The image will appear in the main area of the program.
 
Next, you need to set the scale for the graph. This means that you need to define the coordinates of the axes and the units of measurement. You can do this by clicking on the "Set Scale" button on the toolbar or by selecting "Edit" > "Set Scale" from the menu. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the values for the origin, end points and units of the X and Y axes. You can also use the mouse to click on the image and specify these values graphically. You can also choose whether to use a linear or a logarithmic scale for each axis.
 
After setting the scale, you can start digitizing the graph. You can choose between two tools: "Digitize Line" and "Digitize Point". The former allows you to trace a line along a curve or a straight segment on the graph, while the latter allows you to mark individual points on the graph. You can switch between these tools by clicking on their icons on the toolbar or by pressing "L" or "P" on your keyboard.
 
To digitize a line, you need to click on the starting point of the line on the graph and then move your mouse along the line until you reach the end point. You can also click on intermediate points along the line if you want to adjust its shape. The program will display a red line that follows your mouse movement and shows you the coordinates of each point. You can also see these coordinates in the status bar at the bottom of the program window.
 
To digitize a point, you just need to click on it on the graph. The program will display a red cross that marks its location and shows you its coordinates. You can also see these coordinates in the status bar at the bottom of the program window.
 
You can digitize as many lines and points as you want on the graph. You can also edit, delete or move them if you make a mistake or want to change something. To edit a line or a point, you need to select it by clicking on it with your mouse or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Then you can use the "Edit" menu or right-click on it to access various options, such as "Delete", "Move", "Insert Point", "Remove Point", etc.
 
When you are done digitizing your graph, you can export your data into a file format of your choice. You can do this by clicking on the "Save Data" button on the toolbar or by selecting "File" > "Save Data As" from the menu. A dialog box will appear where you can choose between different formats, such as TXT, XLS, XML, DXF and EPS. You can also specify a file name and a location for your data file.
 
You have successfully digitized your graph in manual mode using GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26!
