## What is XNote Stopwatch 1.66.23?
 
XNote Stopwatch 1.66.23 is a multifunctional software that can operate in two modes: stopwatch mode and countdown timer mode. In stopwatch mode, it measures the elapsed time from zero to any value, and allows you to record the start time, stop time, elapsed time, and split time of each measurement. In countdown timer mode, it counts down from a preset value to zero, and optionally sounds an alarm when the time is up.
 
XNote Stopwatch 1.66.23 has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you start, stop, pause, resume, and reset the timer with just one click. You can also customize the appearance of the timer by changing its size, color, font, transparency, and position on the screen. You can also adjust the format of the displayed time by eliminating hours, minutes, and/or decimals, padding leading values with zeroes, customizing decimals to represent 10, 100 or 1000 of second, 24, 25, 60 TV frames and so on.
 
XNote Stopwatch 1.66.23 supports system-wide, user-redefinable hotkeys that allow you to control the timer without using the mouse. For example, you can use the spacebar to start or stop the timer, F2 to reset it, F5 to switch between modes, F6 to toggle the alarm sound, F11 to toggle full-screen mode, and F12 to take a screenshot of the timer.
 
XNote Stopwatch 1.66.23 can also record the data of each measurement in a log file, which you can export to a text file or copy to the clipboard for further analysis or reporting. You can also record the time directly to a MS Excel cell without awkward export/import operations.
