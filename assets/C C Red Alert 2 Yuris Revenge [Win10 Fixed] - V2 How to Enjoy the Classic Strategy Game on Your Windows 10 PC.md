However, many fans of the game have encountered problems running it on newer operating systems like Windows 10. The game may freeze, crash, or have graphical glitches that make it unplayable. Fortunately, there is a simple solution that can fix these issues and let you enjoy this classic game on your modern PC.
 
## The Graphics Patch Fix
 
The main cause of the problems with C C Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge on Windows 10 is the game's incompatibility with the newer graphics drivers. The game bounces back and forth from virtual to physical RAM for graphics pulls, which can conflict and cause many rendering problems/crashes[^1^].
 
To solve this problem, you need to download and apply a graphics patch fix that will make the game run smoothly on Windows 10. The patch is easy to install and does not require any additional software or modifications. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the patch from [this link](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Command-Conquer-Games/CC-Red-Alert-2-Yuri-s-Revenge-Graphics-Patch-FIX-Windows-8-10/td-p/4840120) and extract (unzip) the file.
2. Make a new empty folder on your desktop and place the extracted file in there.
3. Locate Yuri's game EXE file/ AKA application. It will be under C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Command and Conquer Red Alert II. The file is called gamemd.exe and it is 4,704 KB.
4. Right click on it and copy. You will then want to paste that file in the folder with the patch you created earlier on your desktop.
5. Now you will want to run the patch file and activate the patch. It's so quick and easy it is self-explanatory.
6. Once you have done that, you will now right click on the same EXE file and copy it once more.
7. Re-paste that file back where you got it from in step 3.
8. You're all done. Things should now run really fast and smooth. No more freeze-ups!

This patch works for both Yuri's Revenge EXE (gamemd.exe) and Red Alert 2 EXE (game.exe), so you can follow the same steps for both games if you want to play them on Windows 10.
