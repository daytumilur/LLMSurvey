## Step 2: Choose a Genre and a Template
 
Once you have installed Dance eJay 2 Special Edition, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see a welcome screen that lets you choose a genre and a template for your project. You can select from Dance, Trance, Drum & Bass, House or Hip Hop genres, and from various templates that provide you with pre-made loops and samples for each genre. You can also create your own template by clicking on the "New" button.
 
## Step 3: Drag and Drop Sounds into the Tracks
 
After choosing a genre and a template, you will see the main interface of Dance eJay 2 Special Edition, which consists of a sound browser on the left, a track arranger on the right and a toolbar on the top. The sound browser contains all the sounds that are available for your chosen genre, organized into categories such as drums, bass, synth, vocals and effects. You can preview any sound by clicking on it or by using the keyboard arrows. To add a sound to your project, simply drag and drop it into one of the 16 tracks on the track arranger. You can adjust the volume and pan of each track by using the sliders below them.
 
## Step 4: Edit Sounds with Effect Studio and Time Stretcher
 
If you want to modify or enhance any sound in your project, you can use the Effect Studio or the Time Stretcher tools that are located on the toolbar. The Effect Studio allows you to apply various effects such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, distortion and filter to any sound or track. You can adjust the parameters of each effect by using the knobs and sliders on the effect window. The Time Stretcher allows you to change the tempo and pitch of any sound or track without affecting its quality. You can use the buttons and sliders on the time stretcher window to speed up or slow down any sound or track.
 
## Step 5: Record Your Own Sounds with Microphone Recorder
 
If you want to add your own voice or instrument to your project, you can use the Microphone Recorder tool that is located on the toolbar.
