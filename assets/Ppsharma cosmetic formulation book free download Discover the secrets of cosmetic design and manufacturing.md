Cosmetic formulations are the result of combining various ingredients to create a product that meets the desired specifications and functions. Cosmetic formulations can be classified into different categories, such as emulsions, gels, suspensions, powders, and sticks. Each category has its own characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages.
 
Emulsions are mixtures of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water, that are stabilized by an emulsifier. Emulsions can be either oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O), depending on the phase that surrounds the droplets of the other phase. Emulsions are widely used in cosmetic products, such as creams, lotions, and foundations. Emulsions provide moisturization, protection, and delivery of active ingredients to the skin.
 
Gels are semi-solid systems that consist of a liquid dispersed in a solid network. Gels can be either physical or chemical, depending on the nature of the network. Physical gels are formed by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or electrostatic forces, between the network components. Chemical gels are formed by covalent bonds or cross-linking agents between the network components. Gels are used in cosmetic products, such as hair gels, toothpastes, and eye gels. Gels provide viscosity, stability, and cooling effects to the products.
