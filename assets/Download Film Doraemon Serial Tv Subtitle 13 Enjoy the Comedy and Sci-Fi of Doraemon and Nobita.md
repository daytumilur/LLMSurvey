The title of the book reflects Schopenhauer's central thesis that the world is essentially a manifestation of an irrational and blind will that drives all living beings to strive for existence, satisfaction, and domination. The world as we perceive it, however, is only a representation of this will, filtered through our cognitive faculties and conditioned by space, time, and causality. Schopenhauer argues that human suffering is inevitable in a world governed by will, and that the only way to escape from the cycle of desire and frustration is to renounce the will through art, compassion, or asceticism.
 
Svet kao volja i predstava is divided into four books, each dealing with a different aspect of Schopenhauer's philosophy. The first book discusses the world as representation, and criticizes previous philosophical systems for failing to account for the subjective nature of knowledge. The second book introduces the concept of the will as the thing-in-itself, and analyzes its manifestations in nature, animals, and humans. The third book explores the aesthetic dimension of Schopenhauer's thought, and explains how art can reveal the essence of things beyond their phenomenal appearance. The fourth book examines the ethical and religious implications of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, and proposes a way of salvation through negation of the will.
 
Svet kao volja i predstava is widely regarded as one of the most original and influential works of 19th-century philosophy. It has inspired many thinkers and artists, such as Nietzsche, Wagner, Freud, Tolstoy, Kafka, and Camus. It has also been translated into many languages, including Serbian by Tijana PremoviÄ[^1^], who also wrote a detailed review of the book[^2^]. The book is available for purchase at KnjiÅ¾are Vulkan[^3^], or for download at idoc.pub[^4^].

However, Schopenhauer's philosophy has also faced many criticisms from various perspectives. Some of the main objections are:

- Schopenhauer's concept of the will as the thing-in-itself is inconsistent with Kant's transcendental idealism, which denies any positive knowledge of the noumenal realm. Schopenhauer also fails to explain how the will can be both one and many, and how it can produce the diversity and order of the phenomenal world.[^1^]
- Schopenhauer's pessimism is based on a subjective and exaggerated assessment of human suffering, and ignores the positive aspects of life, such as happiness, beauty, love, and morality. Schopenhauer also neglects the role of reason and freedom in human affairs, and reduces everything to a blind and irrational force.[^2^]
- Schopenhauer's ethics and aesthetics are contradictory and implausible. On the one hand, he advocates compassion and asceticism as the highest virtues, but on the other hand, he praises art and genius as the supreme expressions of the will. Schopenhauer also fails to provide a clear criterion for distinguishing between good and bad art, or between genuine and false asceticism.[^2^]
- Schopenhauer's influence on later thinkers and artists is often overstated or misunderstood. Many of his followers either modified or rejected his core doctrines, such as Nietzsche, who criticized Schopenhauer's nihilism and affirmed life as will to power. Schopenhauer's impact on literature, music, and psychology is also more complex and ambiguous than often assumed.[^3^]

Despite these criticisms, Schopenhauer's philosophy remains a rich and provocative source of insight and inspiration for many people. His analysis of the human condition, his critique of rationalism and materialism, his appreciation of art and mysticism, and his style of writing have all contributed to his lasting appeal and relevance.
