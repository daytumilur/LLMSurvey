Here are some tips and tricks that might help you in your quest:
 
- Save often. The game has a save feature that you can access from the menu. You should save your progress frequently, especially before entering a new room or solving a puzzle. You never know when the monster might appear and kill you.
- Learn some Korean. The game is in Korean, and some of the puzzles require you to read or input Korean characters. If you don't know any Korean, you might have a hard time figuring out what to do. You can use online translators or guides to help you, but it might ruin the immersion and the challenge.
- Explore every corner. The game has many hidden items and clues that you will need to find. Some of them are obvious, but others are well-hidden or require you to interact with certain objects. You should examine everything and try to collect as many items as possible. You might need them later.
- Use your items wisely. The game has a limited inventory space, so you can't carry everything you find. You will have to decide what items are useful and what items are not. Some items are essential for solving puzzles or unlocking doors, while others are just distractions or traps. You should also use your items at the right time and place, otherwise they might be wasted.
- Don't panic. The game is designed to scare you and make you nervous. The monster can appear at any moment and chase you down. The music and sound effects are creepy and unsettling. The graphics are dark and pixelated, adding to the horror vibe. But don't let the game get to you. Stay calm and think rationally. Don't run blindly or make rash decisions. Plan your moves and act accordingly.

Ao Oni School Nightmare is a game that will test your skills and your courage. It is a game that will make you feel scared and thrilled at the same time. If you follow these tips and tricks, you might have a better chance of surviving the horror and escaping the school.
